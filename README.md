# Cookiecutter Deep Learning

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing deep learning work with python._

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2 or 3
 - [cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: `pip install cookiecutter`


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/yh80ywol/cookiecutter-deeplearning-FORK.git

### Credits:

Largely inspired by https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science und https://github.com/tdeboissiere/cookiecutter-deeplearning.git
