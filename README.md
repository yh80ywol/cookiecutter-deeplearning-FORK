# Cookiecutter Deep Learning Fork

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing deep learning work with python (forked)._

### Requirements:
-----------
 - Python 2 or 3
 - [cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: `pip install cookiecutter` or `conda install cookiecutter`


### To get access to the template, run:
------------

    cookiecutter https://github.com/yh80ywol/cookiecutter-deeplearning-FORK.git

### Credits:

Largely inspired by https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science and https://github.com/tdeboissiere/cookiecutter-deeplearning.git
